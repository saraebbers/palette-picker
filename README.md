## Description
Palette Picker is a web application designed to allow the user to create projects and save unique palette colors to each project.   Account handling is done via a local backend built in Express.

You can find the specs for it [here] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html).  Students were provided six days to complete the project including building the database and front end.
